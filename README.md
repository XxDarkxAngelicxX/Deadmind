# Mindless
You play as a young woman named Lily, who wakes up in a dimly lit room with no memory of how she got there. The room is barren, except for a table with a single note that reads: "You are trapped in your own mind. Find the key to escape."

As Lily explores the room, she realizes that it's not just any room - it's a manifestation of her own subconscious. Memories and traumas from her past begin to seep through the cracks of her mind, taking physical form as grotesque creatures that hunt her down.

As Lily progresses through the levels of her own mind, she is forced to confront her inner demons and face the dark corners of her psyche. She must solve puzzles and navigate through surreal environments, all while being pursued by her own fears and anxieties.
