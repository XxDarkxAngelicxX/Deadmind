# Mindless
You play as a young person named Cassidy, who wakes up in a dimly lit room with no memory of how they got there. The room is barren, except for a table with a single note that reads: "You are trapped in your own mind. Find the key to escape."

As Cassidy explores the room, they realize that it's not just any room - it's a manifestation of their own subconscious. Memories and traumas from their past begin to seep through the cracks of their mind, taking physical form as grotesque creatures that hunt them down.

As Cassidy progresses through the levels of their own mind, they are forced to confront their inner demons and face the dark corners of their psyche. they must solve puzzles and navigate through surreal environments, all while being pursued by their own fears and anxieties.
