# Mindless
You play as a young person named Cassidy, who wakes up in a dimly lit room with no memory of how they got there. They are greeted by Two strangers The room is barren, except for a table with a single note that reads: "You are trapped in your own mind. Find the key to escape."

As Cassidy and the people they met explores the room, they realize that it's not just any room - it's a manifestation of their subconscious. Memories and traumas from their past begin to seep through the cracks of their mind, taking physical form as grotesque creatures that hunt them down.

As Cassidy progresses through the levels of their own mind, they are forced to confront their inner demons and face the dark corners of their psyche. they must solve puzzles and navigate through surreal environments, all while being pursued by their own fears and anxieties In they relised is all fake. nothing was real it was all fake the people they met the room they only had them self or was it really fake? or are they just Mindless.
